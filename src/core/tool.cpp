#include "tool.hpp"

// This file is currently empty as Tool is a simple struct-like class.
// If you add member functions in the future, implement them here.

// For example, if you add a constructor:
/*
Tool::Tool(std::string name, std::string description)
    : name(std::move(name)), description(std::move(description)) {}
*/
