# Project Overview and Requirements

## 1. Project Goal
The project is a client library for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically tailored for OpenAI's API but absolutely extensible to other LLM providers.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 LLM Client
- Manages the overall interaction with the LLM service
- Handles message history and tool management
- Interfaces with the Translator and HTTP Client

### 2.2 Translator
- Converts internal data structures to API-specific formats
- Currently implements OpenAI's API requirements
- Extensible for potential future API integrations

### 2.3 HTTP Client
- Provides asynchronous HTTP operations
- Supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Handles request/response cycle

### 2.4 Core Data Structures
- Message: Represents various types of messages in the conversation
- Tool: Represents function-calling capabilities
- Parameter: Defines parameters for tools

## 3. Key Requirements

### 3.1 Flexibility
- Support for different types of messages (system, user, assistant, tool calls, tool results)
- Extensible design to accommodate future LLM features

### 3.2 API Compatibility
- Accurate translation of internal structures to OpenAI API format
- Support for all relevant OpenAI API parameters

### 3.3 Asynchronous Operations
- Non-blocking HTTP requests
- Ability to handle streaming responses

### 3.4 Error Handling
- Robust error handling across all components
- Meaningful error messages and exceptions

### 3.5 Thread Safety
- Thread-safe design for concurrent operations

### 3.6 Performance
- Efficient handling of large messages and responses
- Optimized JSON parsing and generation

### 3.7 Testability
- Comprehensive unit testing for all components
- Mocking of HTTP responses for testing

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Usability
- Simple and intuitive API for end-users of the library
- Clear documentation and usage examples

### 4.2 Maintainability
- Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns
- Use of modern C++ features and best practices

### 4.3 Portability
- Cross-platform compatibility (implied by use of CMake and standard C++)

### 4.4 Security
- Secure handling of API keys and sensitive data
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## 5. Future Considerations

### 5.1 Multi-Provider Support
- Potential extension to support other LLM providers beyond OpenAI

### 5.2 Advanced Features
- Support for more complex conversation flows
- Integration with local LLM models

### 5.3 Performance Optimization
- Potential for response streaming and incremental processing
- Caching mechanisms for improved efficiency

## 6. Build and Deployment

### 6.1 Build System
- Use of CMake for cross-platform build configuration

### 6.2 Dependency Management
- Clear specification of external dependencies (e.g., nlohmann/json, CURL)

### 6.3 Continuous Integration
- Implied requirement for CI/CD pipeline (based on comprehensive test suite)

This overview provides a high-level understanding of the project's requirements and structure. The actual implementation may vary or include additional features not apparent from the provided source files.
