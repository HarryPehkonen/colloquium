This overview provides a high-level understanding of the project's requirements and structure. The actual implementation may vary or include additional features not apparent from the provided source files.
Certainly! I'll create a requirements document for the directory structure, focusing on the organization, CMakeLists.txt files, and the reasoning behind the structure where possible.

Requirements Document: Project Directory Structure

1. Overview:
   The project follows a hierarchical directory structure that separates source code, tests, and build configuration. This organization promotes modularity, ease of navigation, and clear separation of concerns.

2. Root Directory:
   - Contains the top-level CMakeLists.txt file
   - Purpose: Defines the project and sets global configurations

3. src/ Directory:
   - Purpose: Contains all source code for the project
   - CMakeLists.txt location: src/CMakeLists.txt
   - Why: Centralizes build configuration for all source code subdirectories

   3.1. src/core/
       - Purpose: Contains core data structures and classes used throughout the project
       - Files: message.hpp, message.cpp, parameter.hpp, parameter.cpp, tool.hpp, tool.cpp
       - CMakeLists.txt location: src/core/CMakeLists.txt
       - Why: Allows independent compilation of core components and easy linking for other modules

   3.2. src/http_client/
       - Purpose: Contains HTTP client implementation
       - Subdirectories:
         - include/http_client/: Public headers
         - src/: Implementation files
       - CMakeLists.txt location: src/http_client/CMakeLists.txt
       - Why: Separates HTTP client logic, allowing for potential replacement or multiple implementations

   3.3. src/translator/
       - Purpose: Contains translator implementations for different APIs
       - Files: openai_translator.hpp, openai_translator.cpp, itranslator.hpp
       - CMakeLists.txt location: src/translator/CMakeLists.txt
       - Why: Isolates API-specific translation logic, facilitating easy addition of new API translators

   3.4. src/client/
       - Purpose: Contains the main LLM client implementation
       - Files: llm_client.hpp, llm_client.cpp
       - CMakeLists.txt location: src/client/CMakeLists.txt
       - Why: Separates the high-level client logic from other components

4. tests/ Directory:
   - Purpose: Contains all test files for the project
   - CMakeLists.txt location: tests/CMakeLists.txt
   - Why: Centralizes test configuration and allows for easy addition of new test suites

   4.1. tests/core/
       - Purpose: Contains tests for core components
       - Files: message_test.cpp, parameter_test.cpp, tool_test.cpp
       - CMakeLists.txt location: tests/core/CMakeLists.txt
       - Why: Allows for independent testing of core components

   4.2. tests/http_client/
       - Purpose: Contains tests for the HTTP client
       - Subdirectories:
         - unit_tests/: Contains unit tests for HTTP client
       - CMakeLists.txt location: tests/http_client/CMakeLists.txt
       - Why: Separates HTTP client tests, allowing for different types of tests (unit, integration, etc.)

   4.3. tests/llm_client/
       - Purpose: Contains tests for the LLM client
       - Files: (test files for LLM client)
       - CMakeLists.txt location: tests/llm_client/CMakeLists.txt
       - Why: Isolates LLM client tests, potentially including integration tests

5. CMakeLists.txt Files:
   - Each directory contains its own CMakeLists.txt file
   - Why:
     a. Modularity: Allows each component to define its own build requirements
     b. Flexibility: Enables easy addition or removal of components from the build
     c. Clarity: Keeps build configurations close to the relevant source code
     d. Hierarchy: Supports a hierarchical build process where the root CMakeLists.txt includes subdirectories

6. Additional Considerations:
   - The structure allows for easy addition of new components or modules
   - Separation of public headers (in include/ directories) from implementation files supports clear API boundaries
   - Test directories mirror the structure of the src/ directory, making it easy to locate tests for specific components

7. Potential Future Enhancements:
   - Consider adding a docs/ directory for documentation if not already present
   - If the project grows, consider adding a libs/ or external/ directory for third-party dependencies
   - As the project evolves, maintain the parallel structure between src/ and tests/ directories

This directory structure provides a clear organization for the project, separating concerns and allowing for modular development and testing. The use of individual CMakeLists.txt files in each directory supports this modularity in the build process, making it easier to manage and extend the project over time.
Requirements Document: CMakeLists.txt Structure and Configuration

1. Overview:
   The project uses CMake as its build system, with a hierarchical structure of CMakeLists.txt files. Each directory contains its own CMakeLists.txt file, responsible for building the components within that directory and including relevant subdirectories.

2. Global Considerations:
   - Minimum CMake version: 3.10
   - All external dependencies (e.g., JSON, cURL) are assumed to be installed system-wide
   - No automatic fetching of dependencies is performed
   - C++17 is used as the standard throughout the project

3. Root CMakeLists.txt:
   Location: ./CMakeLists.txt
   Contents:
   - Sets the project name and version
   - Sets the C++ standard to C++17

           $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
           $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
       PRIVATE
           ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src
   )

   enable_testing()
   ```

10. Additional Considerations:
    - Each CMakeLists.txt file is responsible for its own directory contents
    - Dependencies are not automatically fetched; they must be installed system-wide
    - The build system supports both Debug and Release configurations
    - Installation rules should be defined in the root CMakeLists.txt file

11. Best Practices:
    - Use target_link_libraries() with PRIVATE, PUBLIC, or INTERFACE specifiers
    - Use generator expressions for build-interface vs. install-interface includes
    - Set project-wide properties and options in the root CMakeLists.txt
    - Use find_package() for system-wide installed libraries
    - Avoid hardcoding paths; use CMake variables like CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR

12. Testing:
    - Use GoogleTest for unit testing
    - Each test directory should have its own CMakeLists.txt file
    - Use gtest_discover_tests() for automatic test discovery
# Message Class Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
The Message class represents a single message in a conversation with an AI model. It encapsulates various attributes of a message, including its type, content, and associated metadata.

## 2. Class Definition

### 2.1 File Location
- Header file: src/core/message.hpp
- Implementation file: src/core/message.cpp

### 2.2 Class Declaration
```cpp
class Message {
public:
    enum class Type { System, User, Assistant, ToolCall, ToolResult };
    
    Message(Type type);
    virtual ~Message() = default;
    
    Type getType() const;
    
    // Public member variables
    std::string content;
    std::optional<std::string> created;
    std::optional<std::string> finish_reason;
    std::optional<int> prompt_tokens;
    std::optional<int> completion_tokens;
    std::optional<int> total_tokens;
    std::optional<std::string> model;
    std::optional<double> temperature;
    std::optional<double> top_p;
    std::optional<int> max_tokens;
    std::optional<int> logprobs;
    std::optional<bool> stream;
    std::optional<int> random_seed;
    std::optional<std::string> response_format_type;

protected:
    Type type_;
};
```

## 3. Enumerations

### 3.1 Message Type
```cpp
enum class Type { System, User, Assistant, ToolCall, ToolResult };
```
- System: Represents system messages or instructions
- User: Represents user input or queries
- Assistant: Represents AI model responses
- ToolCall: Represents a request to use a specific tool
- ToolResult: Represents the result of a tool operation

## 4. Constructors and Destructor

### 4.1 Constructor
```cpp
Message(Type type);
```
- Initializes a new Message object with the specified type
- Sets the `type_` member variable

### 4.2 Destructor
```cpp
virtual ~Message() = default;
```
- Virtual destructor to allow for proper cleanup in derived classes

## 5. Public Methods

### 5.1 getType
```cpp
Type getType() const;
```
- Returns the type of the message
- Should be a const method as it doesn't modify the object

## 6. Member Variables

### 6.1 Required Members
- `content` (std::string): The main content of the message

### 6.2 Optional Members
All optional members should use std::optional to indicate their optional nature:

- `created` (std::optional<std::string>): Timestamp of message creation
- `finish_reason` (std::optional<std::string>): Reason for finishing the response
- `prompt_tokens` (std::optional<int>): Number of tokens in the prompt
- `completion_tokens` (std::optional<int>): Number of tokens in the completion
- `total_tokens` (std::optional<int>): Total number of tokens used
- `model` (std::optional<std::string>): The model used for this message
- `temperature` (std::optional<double>): Sampling temperature
- `top_p` (std::optional<double>): Nucleus sampling parameter
- `max_tokens` (std::optional<int>): Maximum number of tokens to generate
- `logprobs` (std::optional<int>): Number of log probabilities to generate
- `stream` (std::optional<bool>): Whether to stream the response
- `random_seed` (std::optional<int>): Random seed for deterministic output
- `response_format_type` (std::optional<std::string>): Desired response format

## 7. Protected Members
- `type_` (Type): Stores the type of the message

## 8. Functionality Requirements

### 8.1 Type Safety
- The `Type` enum class should be used to ensure type safety when setting or comparing message types

### 8.2 Immutable Type
- The message type should be set at construction and should not be modifiable afterwards

### 8.3 Optional Field Handling
- All optional fields should be easily checkable for the presence of a value
- Accessing an optional field without a value should throw an exception or have well-defined behavior

### 8.4 Serialization Support
- While not implemented in the class itself, the Message class should be designed to support easy serialization and deserialization (e.g., to/from JSON)

## 9. Memory Management
- The class should follow the Rule of Zero or Rule of Five
- If dynamic memory allocation is needed in derived classes, ensure proper memory management

## 10. Thread Safety
- The class should be thread-safe for const operations
- Mutable operations should be clearly documented if they are not thread-safe

## 11. Performance Considerations
- Consider using move semantics for efficient handling of the content string and other large data members
- Evaluate the performance impact of using std::optional for all optional fields

## 12. Extensibility
- The class should be designed to allow easy extension for future message types or additional fields
- Consider using a version number or similar mechanism to handle potential future changes in the message format

## 13. Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for invalid operations (e.g., accessing unset optional fields)
- Use exceptions or error codes as appropriate for the project's error handling strategy

## 14. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests should cover:
  - Construction with different types
  - Getting and setting all fields
  - Proper handling of optional fields
  - Any complex logic in derived classes
- Consider property-based testing for fields with constraints (e.g., temperature range)

## 15. Documentation
- All public methods and member variables should have clear, concise documentation
- Include usage examples in the class documentation
- Document any assumptions or constraints on the values of fields

## 16. Compliance
- Ensure the class adheres to any relevant coding standards or guidelines used in the project
- Consider any data protection or privacy implications of storing message content

## 17. Internationalization
- If applicable, ensure the class can handle content in various languages and character sets

## 18. Future Considerations
- Plan for potential future requirements such as message encryption, compression, or additional metadata fields
Class: Tool

1. Language and Environment:
   - Implemented in C++
   - No specific C++ version requirements noted, but likely C++11 or later due to the use of std::vector

2. Class Definition:
   - Defined in header file: src/core/tool.hpp
   - No inheritance specified
   - Class is designed to represent a tool or function that can be used by an AI system

3. Member Variables (all public):

   - Move constructor (implicitly defined)

5. Member Functions:
   - No explicit member functions defined

6. Operator Overloads:
   - No explicit operator overloads defined

7. Thread Safety:
   - The class itself is not thread-safe
   - Thread safety should be implemented externally if needed in multi-threaded contexts

8. Usage in Other Components:
   - Used in the LLMClient class as part of a vector of tools (std::vector<Tool> tools_)
   - Serialized by the OpenAITranslator class for API requests

9. Serialization:
   - No built-in serialization methods
   - Serialized externally by OpenAITranslator class to JSON format

10. Memory Management:
    - Relies on standard C++ memory management for std::string and std::vector
    - No explicit dynamic memory allocation

11. Error Handling:
    - No specific error handling mechanisms

12. Constraints and Invariants:
    - No explicit constraints or invariants defined
    - Implicit constraint: 'name' and 'description' should not be empty when used in API requests

13. Performance Considerations:
    - No specific performance optimizations noted
    - Consider the impact of potentially large numbers of parameters on performance

14. Testing Requirements:
    - Unit tests should cover:
      a. Default construction
      b. Field assignment (name, description, parameters)
      c. Adding and accessing parameters
      d. Tools with no parameters

    - Used in read-only manner when serializing for API requests

19. Extensibility:
    - Can be extended by adding new member variables if needed
    - Consider adding methods for parameter manipulation if more complex operations are required in the future

20. Documentation:
    - No specific documentation requirements noted
    - Inline comments for member variables and any future methods would be beneficial

21. Relationship with Parameter class:
    - The Tool class contains a vector of Parameter objects
    - Each Parameter in the vector represents an input that the tool accepts
    - The Parameter class should have its own separate requirements document

Note: If more complex operations on tools become necessary in the future (e.g., parameter validation, execution of the tool's function), consider adding appropriate member functions to the Tool class. Also, if thread safety becomes a requirement, it is recommended to implement it via a wrapper class or in the containing LLMClient class rather than modifying the Tool class itself.

Requirements Document: ITranslator Interface

1. Language and Environment:
   - Implemented in C++
   - Requires C++11 or later (due to the use of std::unique_ptr and std::vector)

2. Interface Definition:
   - Defined in header file: src/translator/itranslator.hpp
   - Pure virtual interface (abstract base class)

3. Virtual Methods:
   a. messageToJSON:
      - Purpose: Converts a Message object to its JSON representation
      - Parameters: const Message& message
      - Returns: std::string (JSON string)
      - Pure virtual (= 0)

   b. toolToJSON:
      - Purpose: Converts a Tool object to its JSON representation
      - Parameters: const Tool& tool
      - Returns: std::string (JSON string)
      - Pure virtual (= 0)

   c. createRequest:
      - Purpose: Creates a complete JSON request from a vector of messages and tools
      - Parameters: 
        - const std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Message>>& messages
        - const std::vector<Tool>& tools
      - Returns: std::string (JSON string representing the full request)
      - Pure virtual (= 0)

4. Destructor:
   - Virtual destructor (= default)
   - Ensures proper cleanup of derived classes

5. Usage:
   - Intended to be subclassed by specific translator implementations (e.g., OpenAITranslator)
   - Used polymorphically through pointers or references to ITranslator

6. Thread Safety:
   - The interface itself doesn't guarantee thread safety
   - Implementations should document their thread safety guarantees

7. Error Handling:
   - Introduce a TranslationException class for handling translator-specific errors
   - All methods in ITranslator should be declared noexcept(false) to indicate they may throw exceptions
   - Implementations should throw TranslationException for any translation-related errors

8. Output Format:
   - All output methods (messageToJSON, toolToJSON, createRequest) must return std::string containing valid JSON
   - Add a new method parseJSONToMessage that accepts a std::string containing valid JSON and returns a std::unique_ptr<Message>

9. Statelessness:
    - All translator methods must be stateless
    - Any required state should be passed as parameters to the methods

10. Performance Considerations:
    - Future enhancement: Add support for caching/serializing translated objects to disk
    - This could be implemented as an optional feature in derived classes

11. Dependencies:
   - Includes "core/message.hpp" and "core/tool.hpp"

12. Namespace:
   - Not enclosed in any specific namespace

13. Extensibility:
    - New methods can be added to the interface as needed for future API requirements
    - Existing methods should not be modified to maintain backward compatibility

14. Documentation:
    - Each virtual method should have a clear documentation comment describing its purpose, parameters, and return value

15. Testing:
    - Concrete implementations of this interface should be thoroughly tested
    - Consider creating a mock implementation for testing classes that use ITranslator

Here's an example of how the ITranslator interface might look:

```cpp
// itranslator.hpp
#pragma once
#include "core/message.hpp"
#include "core/tool.hpp"
#include "translator/translation_exception.hpp"
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

class ITranslator {
public:
    virtual ~ITranslator() = default;
    virtual std::string messageToJSON(const Message& message) const noexcept(false) = 0;
    virtual std::string toolToJSON(const Tool& tool) const noexcept(false) = 0;
    virtual std::string createRequest(const std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Message>>& messages,
                                      const std::vector<Tool>& tools) const noexcept(false) = 0;
    virtual std::unique_ptr<Message> parseJSONToMessage(const std::string& json) const noexcept(false) = 0;
};

// translation_exception.hpp
#pragma once
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>

class TranslationException : public std::runtime_error {
public:
    explicit TranslationException(const std::string& message) : std::runtime_error(message) {}
};
```
Requirements Document: TranslationException Class

1. Language and Environment:
   - Implemented in C++
   - Requires C++11 or later

2. Class Definition:
   - Defined in a new header file: src/translator/translation_exception.hpp
   - Inherits from std::runtime_error

3. Constructors:
   - Explicit constructor taking a std::string error message
   - (Optional) Constructor taking an error code and a message

4. Methods:
   - what(): Returns the error message (inherited from std::runtime_error)
   - (Optional) getErrorCode(): Returns the error code if implemented

5. Usage:
   - Thrown by ITranslator implementations when encountering translation-related errors

6. Thread Safety:
   - Should be thread-safe for concurrent access (readonly after construction)

Report: Creating a Comprehensive Requirements Document

1. Purpose:
   This report outlines the process for creating a detailed requirements document for a software component or class. The document should provide sufficient information for another developer or LLM to accurately recreate and understand the component's role within a larger system.

2. Process Overview:
   a. Gather all relevant source files (headers, implementation, tests).
   b. Analyze the component's structure, behavior, and usage.
   c. Systematically document each aspect of the component.
   d. Review and refine the document for completeness and clarity.

3. Document Structure:
   Organize the requirements document into the following sections:

   a. Component Identification
   b. Language and Environment
   c. Class/Component Definition
   d. Member Variables
   e. Constructors and Destructors
   f. Member Functions
   g. Operator Overloads
   h. Thread Safety
   i. Usage in Other Components
   j. Serialization
   k. Memory Management
   l. Error Handling
   m. Constraints and Invariants
   n. Performance Considerations
   o. Testing Requirements
   p. Dependencies
   q. Namespace
   r. File Organization
   s. Usage Patterns
   t. Extensibility
   u. Documentation

4. Detailed Process:

   For each section:
   
   a. Examine the relevant parts of the source code.
   b. Document the findings in clear, concise language.
   c. Include code snippets or examples where they add clarity.
   d. Note any uncertainties or areas needing further investigation.

5. Special Considerations:

   a. Complex Types:
      - For member variables, parameters, or return types that are complex (custom classes or structs), note that a separate requirements document should exist or be created for that type.
      - Briefly describe how the complex type is used in the context of the current component.

   b. Thread Safety:
      - If the component is not inherently thread-safe, state this clearly.
      - Suggest potential external thread safety mechanisms if relevant.

   c. External Dependencies:
      - Clearly list all external libraries or components that this component depends on.

   d. Future Considerations:
      - If there are known plans for future modifications or extensions, include these in the relevant sections.

6. Review and Refinement:
   
   a. After completing the initial draft, review the document for completeness.
   b. Ensure that someone unfamiliar with the component could understand and potentially recreate it from this document.
   c. Refine and clarify any ambiguous or unclear sections.

7. Maintenance:

   a. The requirements document should be updated whenever the component is modified.
   b. Consider versioning the requirements document to track changes over time.

By following this process, you will create a comprehensive and structured requirements document that captures all essential aspects of a software component or class. This document will serve as a valuable resource for understanding, maintaining, and potentially recreating the component in the future.
