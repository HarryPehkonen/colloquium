# HTTP Client Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
The HTTP client should provide a simple interface for making HTTP requests. It should support common HTTP methods and handle responses appropriately.

## 2. Interface
The client should implement the following public methods:

- Get(uri, headers)
- Put(uri, body, headers)
- Post(uri, body, headers)
- Patch(uri, body, headers)
- Delete(uri, headers)

## 3. Functionality Requirements

### 3.1 HTTP Methods
- Support for GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE methods
- Each method should accept a URI and optional headers
- PUT, POST, and PATCH methods should also accept a request body

### 3.2 Request Handling
- Allow setting custom headers for each request
- Support for sending request bodies (for PUT, POST, PATCH)
- Ability to set a timeout for requests

### 3.3 Response Handling
- Return a response object containing:
  - Status code
  - Response headers
  - Response body

### 3.4 Asynchronous Operations
- All methods should return a future or promise to allow for asynchronous operations

### 3.5 Error Handling
- Throw exceptions for network errors, invalid URIs, etc.
- Provide meaningful error messages

### 3.6 Timeout Management
- Allow setting a global timeout for all requests
- Provide a method to get the current timeout setting

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

### 4.1 Thread Safety
- The client should be thread-safe, allowing concurrent requests from multiple threads

### 4.2 Extensibility
- The design should allow for easy addition of new HTTP methods or features in the future

## 5. Out of Scope
- Specific implementation details (e.g., choice of underlying HTTP library)
- SSL/TLS certificate handling
- Authentication mechanisms
- Automatic retries
- Request/response streaming
