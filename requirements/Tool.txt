Class: Tool

1. Language and Environment:
   - Implemented in C++
   - No specific C++ version requirements noted, but likely C++11 or later due to the use of std::vector

2. Class Definition:
   - Defined in header file: src/core/tool.hpp
   - No inheritance specified
   - Class is designed to represent a tool or function that can be used by an AI system

3. Member Variables (all public):
   - std::string name: Stores the name of the tool
   - std::string description: Stores a description of the tool's purpose or functionality
   - std::vector<Parameter> parameters: Stores a list of parameters that the tool accepts

4. Constructors and Destructors:
   - Default constructor (implicitly defined)
   - No explicit destructor defined (using default)
   - Copy constructor (implicitly defined)
   - Move constructor (implicitly defined)

5. Member Functions:
   - No explicit member functions defined

6. Operator Overloads:
   - No explicit operator overloads defined

7. Thread Safety:
   - The class itself is not thread-safe
   - Thread safety should be implemented externally if needed in multi-threaded contexts

8. Usage in Other Components:
   - Used in the LLMClient class as part of a vector of tools (std::vector<Tool> tools_)
   - Serialized by the OpenAITranslator class for API requests

9. Serialization:
   - No built-in serialization methods
   - Serialized externally by OpenAITranslator class to JSON format

10. Memory Management:
    - Relies on standard C++ memory management for std::string and std::vector
    - No explicit dynamic memory allocation

11. Error Handling:
    - No specific error handling mechanisms

12. Constraints and Invariants:
    - No explicit constraints or invariants defined
    - Implicit constraint: 'name' and 'description' should not be empty when used in API requests

13. Performance Considerations:
    - No specific performance optimizations noted
    - Consider the impact of potentially large numbers of parameters on performance

14. Testing Requirements:
    - Unit tests should cover:
      a. Default construction
      b. Field assignment (name, description, parameters)
      c. Adding and accessing parameters
      d. Tools with no parameters
      e. Tools with multiple parameters
      f. Copy construction
      g. Move construction

15. Dependencies:
    - Standard C++ library (for std::string and std::vector)
    - Parameter class (defined in parameter.hpp)

16. Namespace:
    - Not enclosed in any specific namespace

17. File Organization:
    - Declaration in src/core/tool.hpp
    - Implementation (if any) in src/core/tool.cpp

18. Usage Patterns:
    - Typically created and populated with data before being added to an LLMClient object
    - Used in read-only manner when serializing for API requests

19. Extensibility:
    - Can be extended by adding new member variables if needed
    - Consider adding methods for parameter manipulation if more complex operations are required in the future

20. Documentation:
    - No specific documentation requirements noted
    - Inline comments for member variables and any future methods would be beneficial

21. Relationship with Parameter class:
    - The Tool class contains a vector of Parameter objects
    - Each Parameter in the vector represents an input that the tool accepts
    - The Parameter class should have its own separate requirements document

Note: If more complex operations on tools become necessary in the future (e.g., parameter validation, execution of the tool's function), consider adding appropriate member functions to the Tool class. Also, if thread safety becomes a requirement, it is recommended to implement it via a wrapper class or in the containing LLMClient class rather than modifying the Tool class itself.
