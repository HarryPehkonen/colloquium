Class: Parameter

1. Language and Environment:
   - Implemented in C++
   - No specific C++ version requirements noted

2. Class Definition:
   - Defined in header file (likely parameter.hpp)
   - No inheritance specified

3. Member Variables (all public):
   - std::string name: Stores the name of the parameter
   - std::string type: Stores the type of the parameter (e.g., "number", "string", "integer")
   - std::string description: Stores a description of the parameter
   - bool required: Indicates whether the parameter is required or optional (default initialized to false)
   - std::vector<std::string> enum_values: Stores possible values for enumerated parameters (default initialized to an empty vector)

4. Constructors and Destructors:
   - Default constructor (implicitly defined)
   - No explicit destructor defined (using default)
   - Copy constructor (implicitly defined)
   - Move constructor (implicitly defined)

5. Member Functions:
   - No explicit member functions defined

6. Operator Overloads:
   - No explicit operator overloads defined

7. Thread Safety:
   - The class itself is not thread-safe
   - Thread safety can be implemented externally (e.g., via a wrapper class) if needed in multi-threaded contexts

8. Usage in Other Classes:
   - Used in the Tool class as a member variable (std::vector<Parameter> parameters)
   - Serialized by the OpenAITranslator class for API requests

9. Serialization:
   - No built-in serialization methods
   - Serialized externally by OpenAITranslator class to JSON format

10. Memory Management:
    - Relies on standard C++ memory management for std::string and std::vector
    - No explicit dynamic memory allocation

11. Error Handling:
    - No specific error handling mechanisms

12. Constraints and Invariants:
    - No explicit constraints or invariants defined

13. Performance Considerations:
    - No specific performance optimizations noted

14. Testing Requirements:
    - Unit tests should cover:
      a. Default construction
      b. Field assignment
      c. Empty and non-empty enum_values
      d. Copy construction
      e. Move construction

15. Dependencies:
    - Standard C++ library (for std::string and std::vector)

16. Namespace:
    - Not enclosed in any specific namespace

17. File Organization:
    - Declaration likely in parameter.hpp
    - No separate implementation file (.cpp) needed for this simple struct-like class

18. Usage Patterns:
    - Typically created and populated with data before being added to a Tool object
    - Used in read-only manner when serializing for API requests

19. Extensibility:
    - Can be extended by adding new member variables if needed

20. Documentation:
    - No specific documentation requirements noted, but inline comments for member variables would be beneficial

Note: If thread safety becomes a requirement in the future, it is recommended to implement it via a wrapper class rather than modifying the Parameter class itself. This maintains the simplicity and flexibility of the current design.
